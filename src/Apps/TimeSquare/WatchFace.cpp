//I don't like putting non code related comments here
//but I really wanted to document the fact that I wanted
//a clever name for the watch face so i asked chat gpt for one
//and gave me time square, i asked for an initaliser func name
//and got square up, I really wanna use that.

/// @brief Calling this function will do the following:
/// 1) Clear the screen
/// 2) Unload anything before
/// 3) Show the Watch face.
void ShowWatchFace(){
