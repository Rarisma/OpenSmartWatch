## Welcome to the OpenSmartWatch project

OpenSmartWatch (OSW) is an attempt at making an Arduino based smartwatch; at this stage OSW is an extremely experental project with sporadic developmeent.
The aim of the project is provide a light weight smart watch that can be made for relatively cheap with ideally off the shelf parts.

The main focus of OSW is making as much use of the hardware we have as possible to extend not only features available to us but to also extend the life span of the device.

OSW is unlikely to ever go one to one against flagship smartwatches such as the apple watch or other various large android smartwatches due to sheer size of the ecosystems each one has however OSW should provide many similar features such as weather, alarms and who could forget a clock to tell thime. In this regard OSW is already well on it's way however I hope to provide more than just that should I be able to. 

These are some example ideas of features, some of these may ultimately turn out to be unusable/infeasable for many reasons however given the hardware it is possible on paper:

- USB Drive Mode
    ESP32-S3s provide a USB-OTG interface this may allow us to store files on an SD Card within the watch.
- Play music to headphones from MP3s
    ESP32s have Bluetooth Low-Enegy (BLE) and this in theory should allow basic audio playback from the watch to paired wireless headphones
- Phone Notifications
    With a phone app, notifications should be able to be sent to your watch.

As mentioned before these may be totally unfeasable, but they are things I would like to explore within the comming months as OSW continues to develop.


# So what do I need to build one?
Slow down there.
Currently OSW is just a breadboard with some buttons, a board and display, until it's properly fleshed out on a breadboard I have no intention of putting it on my wrist or yours.

If you are intrested in what hardware is supported by OSW, you should totally check out the readme on the github since it's updated more frequently than this page.

# Who's behind OSW?

Currently just me, Rarisma; I'd be happy for people to contribute to OSW though

# How do I keep up with OSW?
